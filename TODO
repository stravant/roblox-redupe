Prio Features
* Script Injection Permission
* Remember the axis size / offset for duplicated objects that got ResizeAligned (can optimize the check for resizable contents to just checking that attribute if we do this)
* Something weird is happening with group as folder making empty models
* Build an model resize mode setting (shown after resizing)
* Save a ResizeAlign direction for parts (?)
* Allow specifying a random amount of offset per axis

Features
* Visual description of multiply snap by count
* Line up the pixels correctly
* Figure out how to move Rotation back from settings to draggerContext
* Don't use wedges for ResizeAlign when angle is modulo 90
* Make modulo 90 check more generous, allowing one axis off
* Rotate handles don't allow 90 degree rotation in one of the directions

Bugs
* UIPath breaks event handling for containing ScrollingFrame (Can't repro with minimal example??)
* Resize + stale CanvasGroup chip results in missing content
