Priority
* Figure out how to allow resizing smaller than something started
* Visual description of multiply snap by count
* Somehow support extrude

Other
* When bent, avoid placing redundant copies exactly over other copies
* Make move handles look more distinct?
* Make UI dockable as a panel (do I want this?).
