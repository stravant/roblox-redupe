Priority
* Preload tutorial images
* Visual description of multiply snap by count
* Somehow support extrude
* Line up the pixels correctly

Other
* When bent, avoid placing redundant copies exactly over other copies
* Make move handles look more distinct?
* Make UI dockable as a panel (do I want this?).
